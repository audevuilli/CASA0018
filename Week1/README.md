**CASA0018 - Lecture #1**

What are some key things to remember from the lecture? 

The anatomy of a TinyML System is composed of 7 steps. 
1. Decide the tasks of the ML algorithm. 
2. Build a dataset. Collect a variety of data. 
3. Decide the architecture of the model. 
4. Train the model. Select optimising parameters, number of epochs, …. 
5. Convert the model. 
6. Deploy the model on MCUs. Run inference. 
7. Evaluate the model. Troubleshooting. 

What are some applications of ML? 
- Image Classification (ex: Cat vs. Dog)
- Object Detection - Bounding Box (Ex: Trees, Apples, Oranges)
- Image Segmentation - Colouring (Ex: Cars, People, Buildings) 
- Machine Translation
- Recommendations

A few definitions: 
- Machine Learning: The ability to acquire their own knowledge by extracting patterns from raw data. 
- Autoencoder: Combination of an seconder function, which converts the input data into a different representation, and a decoded function, which converts the new representation back into the original format.
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A mathematic function (formed by many simpler functions) mapping some set of input values to output values. 
- Learning: Finding the right weights and biases.
