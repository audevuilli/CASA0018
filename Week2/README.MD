## CASA0018 Week 2

An overview of models' architecture. 

Question 1 - Why adding  dense layers to a Model? 
- (+) Learn more complex representations of the input data. First layer extracts low-level features, subsequent layers can extract higher-level features. Improve performance of the model, as more abstract concepts can be learn. 
- (-) Overfitting or too large and heavy model for the task to solve.
